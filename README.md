# template-general

This is a general template for The Baltimore Sun built around Pug and SCSS.

The Pug file will remain largely bare with little to no styles. However, mixins and variables will be added in for both Pug and SCSS to facilitate faster development in the future.

The package.json file will also be developed for faster workflows.
